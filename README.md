Project Description: Gold Price Prediction
This project focuses on predicting gold prices using machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest Regression. The aim is to develop a model that can analyze historical gold price data and forecast future prices based on key economic indicators.

Objectives:
Collect and preprocess historical gold price data.
Analyze correlations between gold prices and other economic factors.
Train a Random Forest Regressor model to predict gold prices.
Evaluate the model using performance metrics such as R-squared error.
Visualize actual vs. predicted values to assess model accuracy.
